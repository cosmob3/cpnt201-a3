Started working on this assignment yesterday but I only got it started to the point of installing `tailwind` and testing that it was working. 

Made sure all of the stuff that needs configuring is all good.

Starting it off was a bit slow. Getting to know the shortcut expressions for `tailwind` took a bit but once I got more comfortable using the documentation and remembered some of the expressions it made it super quick and easy.

Was having issues resizing the images because the `w-` with a percentage like 1/2 wasn't working. Deleted the packages and reinstalled them and it was working just fine. 

Tried addding a background to the footer but `bg-purple-800` not working for some reason

Deleted some of the files and re-installed `tailwind` and now bg-colors is working. This is kind of frustrating.

***Tailwind***
- Overall, I really enjoyed using tailwind as it cames the styling process much quicker with its shortcuts and the fact that you are able to do it all right from the html page. It would get frustrating at times when certain things would work but others would not. Had to delete files and re-install them like 3-4 times so that everything worked more or less how I wanted it to. 

- From my understanding, a framework is like a library or pre-set that you can use to enhance the programming process.
