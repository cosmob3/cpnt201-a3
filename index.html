        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">What is Tailwind?</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">Tailwind CSS is self-described as a utility first CSS framework. Rather than focusing on the functionality of the item
        being styled, Tailwind is centered around how it should be displayed. This makes it easier for the developer to test out
        new styles and change the layout.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">Why Use Tailwind?</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">Since it offers a faster styling process and is a responsive and stable framework, it's here to stay. Tailwind can help
        you save time and change the way you design websites, and so taking the time to test it out is worthwhile.</p>
